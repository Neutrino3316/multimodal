1. using COVAREP to extract audio features, instead of pyAudioAnalysis
2. incorporate modality embeddings and position embeddings
3. no lstm for visual uni-encoding
4. initialize CLS tokens with average outputs of unimodal
5. use the first order difference of audio features
6. address the heterogeneity
7. generate new example by masking different positions -- address the imbalance issue
